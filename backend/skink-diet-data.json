      "Keep skink diet at about 50% vegetables, 40% protein, and 10% fruits. Increase protein to 50% for baby skinks.",
      "Only give out fruits as a treat",
      "Basil is considered a treat!",
      "If a skink is healthy and not eating or only picking out favorites, it might be overfed - a picky skink is not a hungry skink.",
      "Choosing between cat and dog food? Give your skink cat food when they're a baby because it contains more protein. Switch to dog food when they're at least 5 months old.",
      "Skinks have slow metabolisms and do not need as much food as a mammal. Don't worry if they don't eat the recommended amounts.",
      "Use a cheese grater or food processor for hard veggies like squashes and parsnip.",
      "Veggies and greens will generally not be as popular as protein or fruit, so chop finely and mix with other foods.",
      "Fruit should be a treat (even healthy fruits!) and not more than 10% of the diet.",
      "Insects are essential to a skink diet. Make sure they are sold specifically for reptile consumption. For the squimish, you can use canned insects.",
      "Skinks have difficulty digesting dairy and carbs so minimize both",
      "If feeding beef or chicken, cook it to reduce risk of contamination.",
      "Eggs can be eaten raw or boiled. Skinks eat raw eggs in the wild, including shells. We recommend feeding quail eggs and crushing shells if serving"
